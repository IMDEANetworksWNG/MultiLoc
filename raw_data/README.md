This folder has the raw data as collected directly from the routers. The important ones are:

* aoa_and_ftm: Those are the measurements over the 109 points on the measurement room

* with_rotation_table_2 and with_rotation_table_3: Measurements at IMDEA with a rotation table and with anecoic (however you write that) panels, measurements on pan from -60 to 60 and on tilt from -5 to 5 degrees with a resolution of 0.5 degrees.

* elevation_measurements: The pan is centered at 0, the tilt goes from -20 to 20 degrees with steps of 0.5 degrees.

The rest you can ignore, most of them were tests for other parts of the system, and with_rotation_table are wrong because the rotation table chose not to work.
